# Production Environment Variables Template
#
# This file lists OS-level environment variables that the DICOM Backup System
# application or its deployment scripts might use.
#
# The primary application configuration, including DICOM AE details,
# database connections, and operational parameters (e.g., max_uids_per_run,
# SQL queries), is defined in `src/config/environments.toml` under specific
# environment sections (e.g., [UCLA], [TJU]).
#
# This .env template is primarily for:
# 1. Overriding default logging levels.
# 2. Providing actual secret values for placeholders defined in `environments.toml`.

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL="INFO" # Recommended: INFO for production. Can be DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR.

# Secrets - Corresponding placeholders should exist in environments.toml
# Example: In environments.toml -> Mosaiq source -> db_password = "__UCLA_MOSAIQ_DB_PASSWORD__"
# The application will need logic to look for these environment variables and substitute them.
# Alternatively, your deployment process/secrets manager should inject these.

# Example for UCLA Environment Mosaiq DB Password
# UCLA_MOSAIQ_DB_PASSWORD=""

# Example for TJU Environment Mosaiq DB Password
# TJU_MOSAIQ_DB_PASSWORD=""

# Add other OS-level environment variables if your deployment scripts or specific
# operational needs require them (e.g., proxy settings, application performance tuning flags).
# Ensure PYTHONPATH is correctly set in the execution environment (e.g., systemd service file, Dockerfile)
# to include the project's 'src' directory if running as modules.
# Example: PYTHONPATH=/opt/dicom-backup-system/src (typically not set via .env file for production services)
