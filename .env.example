# RadOncBackupSystem Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the actual values.
# Do NOT commit the .env file to version control.

# Example for a database password (e.g., for Mosaiq)
# Replace "YOUR_SOURCE_ID" and "YOUR_DB_NAME" with specific identifiers if you have multiple.
# EXAMPLE_DB_PASSWORD="your_actual_password_here"

# Example for UCLA Mosaiq DB Password (specific example based on current config)
# This would correspond to an entry in environments.toml like:
# db_password_env_var = "UCLA_MOSAIQ_DB_PASSWORD"
UCLA_MOSAIQ_DB_PASSWORD="your_ucla_mosaiq_db_password_here"

# Example for a generic service API key
# SERVICE_API_KEY="your_service_api_key"

# Flask specific configurations (if Flask app settings are also managed via .env)
# FLASK_APP_SECRET_KEY="a_very_strong_random_secret_key_for_flask_sessions"
# FLASK_DEBUG="False" # Set to "True" for development debugging

# API Key for securing Flask endpoints
RADONC_API_KEY="your_secret_api_key_here"

# Add other potential secrets here as they are identified or needed.
# For example, if DICOM AE titles or ports were considered sensitive for a specific setup:
# MY_CALLING_AET_TITLE="BACKUP_SCU"
# ORTHANC_PEER_AET_TITLE="ORTHANC_SCP"
# ORTHANC_PEER_HOST="127.0.0.1" # This is unlikely to be a secret
# ORTHANC_PEER_PORT="4242" # This is also unlikely
# Generally, connection details like host/port/AET are in config files unless truly dynamic or highly sensitive.
# Passwords, API keys, and secret keys are primary candidates for .env.
